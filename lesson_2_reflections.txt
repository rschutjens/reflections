What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1. When you initialize a repository it creates the initial files in a hidden folder.
2. This tells git to record the history of the files in the folder.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

1. check with git diff if your change is in the staging area.
2. check git diff --staged to see if your change is the one you want to make compared to the last commit.

What are some situation in which branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

1. to organize multiple implementation of specific code.
2. to experiment with your code, but keep a working/main version intact.
3. dividing up larger projects into multiple smaller ones, each working on their own part from a point in the main branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

1. you see what commits are connected or reachable from a specific branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

1. when you merge, git uses the 2 branches AND the point where they were still the same to combine all changes into one branch.
2. The commits of both branches can now be accessed from the new merged branch point.
3. you can delete the other branch label now as it wont be needed anymore to access the commits.
