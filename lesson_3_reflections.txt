When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. if you collaborate with other people on a project.
2. if you are working on different machines.
3. if you like to share your project with other people.
4. to backup your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

1. when multiple people work on the same project it won't work if your local version updates automatically to someone else's commit while you work on it.
2. you might not be ready to push your changes to the public version of the project.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?

1. you use a fork to add someone's repository on github to your own github.
2. you use a clone to make any copy of a repository on your local device (either from github or just copy a project).
3. you use branches to structure the work on one specific repository.
